### Data Description

Prepare `csv` files for `candidate` smiles and `target` smiles, the output file should be `csv` file as well.

The candidate and target files should have two columns, which are `ID` and `SMILES`.

The candidate and target file format example. e.g.

Columns `ID` of output file is the id of candidate smiles. The other columns are combine by target id and similarity method. For instance, the column `Structure2D_CID_23725625_COS` is target `Structure2D_CID_23725625` computing by `COS` method.

PS: `COS` is mol2vec similarity, `D3` is 3d similarity, `Struc` is 2d similarity.

The output file format example. e.g.

### Program Parameter Description

```
`-c` means Candidate data filename, required.
`-t` means Target data filename, required.
`-o` means output data filename, default file name is "output".
`-p` means input file path, include candidate file, target file, output file and mol2vec model. Default path is "./data"
`-cores` means the number of computing cores, default number is 20.
`--save` means wether need save the final result or not, default False.
```

### Quick Sample

```python
python Main.py -c "candidate.csv" -t "target.csv" --save
